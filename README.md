# AICoder Research Project

## Overview

The AICoder project investigates the effectiveness of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism in enhancing programming prompts created by novice programmers. This research evaluates how RAG, combined with Large Language Models (LLMs), can improve the generation of correct solutions for data structure-related programming tasks.

## Objective

The study's primary goal is to understand the potential of RAG and LLMs in assisting junior programmers by providing enriched programming prompts that lead to correct and efficient solutions.

## Experiment Design
- **Resources:** Utilizes the [AlgorithmsAndDataStructure](https://github.com/Py-Contributors/AlgorithmsAndDataStructure) repository for code snippets.
- **Procedure:** Participants are asked to create prompts based on data structure-related questions. These prompts are processed using RAG to fetch relevant code snippets and generate solutions through an LLM.

## Expected Outcomes

The project aims to offer insights into how participants interact with the system and the success rate of solutions generated by combining RAG with LLMs, focusing on the clarity and precision of the prompts provided.
